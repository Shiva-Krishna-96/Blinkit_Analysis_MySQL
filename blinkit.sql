DATA CLEANING:
Cleaning the Item_Fat_Content field ensures data consistency and accuracy in analysis. 
The presence of multiple variations of the same category (e.g., LF, low fat vs. Low Fat) 
can cause issues in reporting, aggregations, and filtering. By standardizing these values, 
we improve data quality, making it easier to generate insights and maintain uniformity in our datasets.
